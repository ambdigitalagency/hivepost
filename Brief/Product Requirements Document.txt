It takes too long, I’m not confident, and I’m afraid I’ll post something wrong.”**Business problem (for MVP):**Can we prove SMB owners will repeatedly use a tool that turns their real conversations into usable content, and do they value the output enough to continue?---# 4) MVP Scope (Hard Constraints)## 4.1 Output types?
